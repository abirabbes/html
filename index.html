          Orchids are popular house plants and make a beautiful addition to
          house plant displays. Moth orchids (Phalaenopsis) are the most common
          type of orchid grown in the UK, found everywhere from garden centres
          to supermarkets. Flowering over a long period, they’re available in an
          increasingly wide range of flower colours. The popularity of moth
          orchids has led to other types of orchids becoming more readily
          available to grow as house plants. These include Dendrobium orchids,
          Paphiopedilum orchids, Oncidium orchids, Vanda orchids and Cambria
          hybrid orchids. These are all easy to grow in most homes, producing
          dramatic displays of exotic blooms. Most orchids need bright but
          indirect light – an east or west-facing windowsill is often perfect.
          Too much light can scorch the leaves, so don’t stand in direct
          sunshine. Most indoor orchids come from humid, tropical regions, so
          need a humid atmosphere. In most centrally heated homes the air is
          dry, so mist the foliage every two to three days using tepid water
          (avoid spraying the flowers), or stand the pot on a tray of damp
          gravel. Different types of orchid need slightly different care, so it
          can be useful to keep the plant label after purchase. But, broadly
          speaking, grow orchids in specialist orchid compost, avoid watering
          them too much, and feed with orchid fertiliser from spring until
          autumn. Follow our essential orchid care tips, to ensure your orchids
          flower and thrive for many years.
